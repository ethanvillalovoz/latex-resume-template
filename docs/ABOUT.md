# 🧠 Behind the Resume: Why This Template Works

This LaTeX resume template was created and refined by Ethan Villalovoz to be **clean, professional, ATS-friendly**, and **impactful for technical roles** in software engineering, AI/ML, robotics, and research. Here's a breakdown of the design philosophy and technical choices that make this resume effective:

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Audience

This template is designed for:
- Students and early-career professionals applying to **internships**, **fellowships**, **research roles**, and **new grad tech positions**
- Developers and researchers looking to showcase **projects**, **technical skills**, and **experience** concisely
- Anyone who wants a **LaTeX-powered**, fully customizable resume with clean formatting

## ✅ Why It’s a Great Resume Template

### 📌 1. **ATS-Compatible & PDF-Readable**
- Uses `\pdfgentounicode=1` to ensure machine-readable output
- Avoids tables and graphics that can break ATS parsing
- Prioritizes semantic structure (e.g., headings, bullet points, links)

### 🎨 2. **Minimalist & Scannable**
- Clear, single-page layout with tightly controlled spacing
- Bolded **technologies** and **key phrases** improve skimmability
- Focused on high-impact bullet points with quantifiable results

### ✍️ 3. **Bullet Points Follow the XYZ Resume Formula**
All bullet points follow the **XYZ formula**:
> **"Accomplished X, by doing Y, as measured by Z"**

This ensures:
- Every line demonstrates **impact**, not just responsibility
- You communicate both **technical depth** and **business value**
- Recruiters and hiring managers immediately understand your contributions

Example:
> “Optimized data sampling strategies to scale job execution from **1% to 100%** within **4 hours**, achieving a **66% reduction in runtime**”

### 🛠 4. **Custom LaTeX Commands for Reusability**
- `\resumeItem{}` for clean bullet formatting
- `\resumeSubheading{}` and `\resumeProjectHeading{}` for layout consistency
- Easy to add sections or modify spacing using defined macros

### 💡 5. **Tailored for Technical Roles**
- Shows off technical depth with sections like:
  - **Technical Skills** (grouped by purpose)
  - **Projects** with tech stacks and outcomes
  - **Experience** with clear, outcome-driven bullet points

## 💬 Creator Note

> "I made this because I never found a LaTeX resume that felt both modern and practical for tech applications. I believe resume templates should be free, accessible, and optimized for real success — not gatekept behind templates that lack substance or clarity."
